#Given a list as a parameter,write a function that returns a list of numbers that are less than ten
#For example: Say your input parameter to the function is [1,11,14,5,8,9]...Your output should [1,5,8,9]

    def list():
        num = [num for num in list if num <10]
    return nums
list (1,11,14,5,8,9) 

#Write a function that takes in two lists and returns the two lists merged together and sorted
#Hint: You can use the .sort() method

l_1 = [1,2,3]
l_2 = [4,5,6,7]
#Expected: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

def join_lists(l_1, l_2):
    
    join_list - l_1 + l_2
    join_lists.sort()
